A smallsat in LEO with initial orbital elements a=7028 km; e=0; i=10°; Ω=30°; ω=0°; ν=0° performs a series of maneuvers to rendezvous with a satellite at GEO with initial orbital elements a=42164 km; e=0; i=0°; Ω=0°; ω=0°; ν=180°. The LEO satellite can generate a maximum thrust of 0.468 km/s per burn.
This repository contains all MATLAB files required to run the simulation. The simulation is in the file 'a_Master_Simulation.m' All other files contain necessary classes and functions.
